          This version of
          <a href="https://buildwith.ionos.com/">Buildwith IONOS</a> is bleeding
          edge and is focused on functionality first.

        <h3>Feature set</h3>
        <p>
          We are far from feature completeness yet. But we think it's time for a
          friendly user test. We've lot of ideas to improve this tool. Feel free
          to share your thoughts with us.
        </p>
        <h3>Custom domains &amp; SSL</h3>
        <p>
          Custom domains &amp; SSL is not implemented yet.
        </p>
        <h3>Limits</h3>
        <p>
          You can build max. 25 instances. It doesn't matter if you build 25
          projects or if you use 25 feature branches of one project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Max. quota of one instance is 500 MB for now.
        </p>
        <h3>UX design</h3>
        <p>
          The tool is build with focus on function first by developers. No UX
          designer was involved so far. We like to ask for your indulgence.
        </p>
        <h3>Data durability</h3>
        <p>
          All data is volatile. Don't rely on any data durability with this
          toolset yet.
        </p>
        <h3>Translation</h3>
        <p>
          For now, no translations are planned. It's a tool for users who are
          familiar with development tools and the most common tools for
          developers are English only.
        </p>
        <h3>Legal requirements</h3>
        <p>
          A legal compliance check is outstanding.
        </p>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>
          Buildwith IONOS is provided "as is" and you use the application at
          your own risk.
